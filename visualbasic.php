<center><h3>Introduction to Visual Basic</h3></center>

<h4>Application has two parts</h4> 
<b>User Interface-</b>  This is the screen displayed by
the application. We interact with an
application via the interface. <br><br>
Every application has a user interface in one
form or the other. The application asks for and
we provide the necessary instructions using
the interface <br><br>
<b>Program-</b> Computer needs clear-cut
instructions to tell them what to do how to do
and when to do.<br><br>
A set of instructions to carry out a specified
task is called a program which is running in
the background.<br><br>
All interactions between the user and the
application are via the user interface. 
<br><br>
Thus for any application to be successful it
needs to have a good user interface. The user
interface makes a program easy to use. A
good user interface will be<br><br>

Easy to learn<br><br>
Easy to use<br><br>
Attractive <br><br>
The different types of system based on the
interface<br><br>
Character Based System<br><br>
Graphical User Interface System<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>Character Based System </b>
In character-based system, text was the
medium of information exchange. The
application displayed text that prompted the
user for the required information. It also
specified the valid options(if any)<br><br>
The user then responded to these prompts by
specifying the required information. 
<br><br>
For example the character based application
may prompt for the information required to
generate an order as shown in figure <br><br>

The user moves from one field to another
specifying the necessary information.<br><br>
Note that listed below are the various option
such as Print and Save and the key
combinations that are to be used to achieve
the necessary action.<br><br>


For example the key combination <Ctrl+P>
will print the Order.<br><br>
Such application is not very easy to use
essentially because the user cannot react
intuitively to this interface <br><br>

For example when the user has to move onto a
New Bill he has to read the bottom of the
screen and use the key combination <Ctrl+N>.<br><br>
Similarly the user has to remember all the
items that are sold by the shop. There is no list
from which he can select a product from those
available. <br><br>
<b>Disadvantage</b> - Character based systems was
that with each new application the user has to
spend time and effort getting used to the way
it worked.

<center><h4>Graphical User Interface</h4></center>

With the advent of graphical operating
systems like Windows the world of computing
went through a dramatic change. <br><br>
It opened up a whole new world of graphics<br><br>
Interfaces that use graphics came to be know
as Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br><br>
These became very popular because the user
could identify with the graphics displayed on
screen GUIs have revolutionized the computer
industry.<br><br>
They demonstrated that the proverb “A
picture is worth a thousand words” hasn’t lost
its truth to most computer users.
<br><br>
The primary requirement for an interface is
that it is easy to use.<br><br>
We must be able to react intuitively to an
interface presented to us.<br><br>
This is possible if the interface presented in
such that it emulates real life.
<br><br>
E.g. consider the calculator.<br><br>
In a physical calculator there are buttons for
each of the numbers and operations possible.
With the use of graphical user interface
application which has a similar interface and
working is possible.<br><br>


Windows applications have a consistent user
interface.<br><br>
This means that the user can spend more
time mastering the application and less time
worrying about which keystrokes do what
operations.<br><br>

<center><h4>Need for Visual Programming </h4></center>

There are several programming tools that
allow us to build visual appealing and intuitive
interface. <br><br>
These tools allow us to design interfaces that
employ user-friendly features such as menus,
buttons, windows etc. Java is a programming
language that helps to build intuitive interface.<br><br> 
Disadvantage of such tools is that the
interface is designed using code.<br><br>
The programmer has to code the user
interface features specifying the size, position
etc.<br><br>
This makes designing the user interface a
major task in itself. <br><br>

For example for the calculator displayed.<br><br>
The programmer has to create each of the user
interface features individually.<br><br>
So programmer has to write code that will
create and display<br><br>
The Windows<br><br>
The 20 buttons<br><br>
The text box <br><br>
The buttons are to be sized and positioned
such that they form a symmetrical and
aesthetically pleasing interface.<br><br>
The text on each button is to represent its
use. This is as far as the design of the interface
is concerned.<br><br>
The next step is to code the functionality to be
provided by the system.<br><br>

Each time the user clicks on a button the
application must determine which button has
been clicked and perform the necessary
action.<br><br>
When a number button is clicked the number
is to be displayed otherwise the selected
operation is to be performed. This has to be
implemented by writing code.
<br><br>
Therefore a programmer spends a lot of time
writing code for the user interface.<br><br>
Large percentage of the time is wasted in
actions such as aligning the buttons properly,
determining which button has been clicked and
then executing the appropriate code. <br><br>

<center><h4>Visual Programming </h4></center>

In the case of the calculator application, as a
programmer won’t you be happy if you have a
programming tool which allows you to simply
click and place buttons and text box without
writing any code.  <br><br>

Visual Programming aims at providing the user
with an interface that is intuitive and easy to
use. In developing such an interface the
programmer employs user-friendly features
such as windows, menus buttons and list
boxes. <br><br>
A visual programming environment
provides all features that are required to
develop a graphical user interface as ready to
use components.<br><br>
The programmer does not have to write code
to create and display commonly required userfriendly features each time around.<br><br>


When the programmer needs a specific user
interface feature such a button, he selects the
appropriate ready to use components
provided by the visual programming
environment.<br><br>


These components can be moved ,resized
and renamed as required<br><br>
For example if the programmer needs to
have a button then the visual programming
environment provides him with one. <br><br>
All that the programmer does is select a
button and place it on screen at the required
position.<br><br>
Typically the mouse is used to select and place
the necessary component.<br><br>
The visual programming environment is called
as point and click environment.<br><br>

A visual programming environment automates
the process of creating a user interface.<br><br>
The interface provided by the visual
programming environment to the
programmer is called the visual interface.<br><br>


Using the visual interface the programmer
designs the user interface visually instead of
writing code.<br><br>
Visual programming environment also
provides a means of associating code with
each component. In the case of calculator for
each button we can specify that the code is to
be executed when we click on it’s buttons.<br><br>
<center><h4>Integrated Development Environment</h4></center>
One of the most significant changes in Visual
Basic 6.0 is the Integrated Development
Environment (IDE).<br><br>
IDE is a term commonly used in the
programming world to describe the interface
and environment that we use to create our
applications. <br><br>

It is called integrated because we can access
virtually all of the development tools that we
need from one screen called an interface.<br><br>
The IDE is also commonly referred to as the
design environment, or the program<br><br>
The Visual Basic IDE is made up of a number of
components.<br><br>
•<b></b> Menu Bar<br><br> <b></b>
•<b></b>Tool Bar<br><br>
• <b></b>Project Window<br><br>
•<b></b> Properties window<br><br>
• <b></b>Form Layout Window<br><br>
• <b></b>Toolbox<br><br>
•<b></b> Form Designer<br><br>
• <b></b>Object Browser<br><br>
•<b></b> Code Window<br><br>

In previous versions of Visual Basic, the IDE
was designed as a Single Document Interface
(SDI).<br><br>
In a Single Document Interface, each window
is a free-floating window that is contained
within a main window and can move
anywhere on the screen as long as Visual Basic
is the current application. <br><br>

In Visual Basic 6.0, the IDE is in a Multiple
Document Interface (MDI) format. In this
format, the windows associated with the
project will stay within a single container
known as the parent.<br><br>
Code and form-based windows will stay within
the main container form. <br><br>

<h4>Menu Bar</h4>
This Menu Bar displays the commands that are
required to build an application. The main
menu items have sub menu items that can be
chosen when needed.<br><br>
The toolbars in the menu bar provide quick
access to the commonly used commands and a
button in the toolbar is clicked once to carry
out the action represented by it. <br><br>
<h4>Toolbar</h4>
The Visual Basic toolbar that you see beneath
the menu bar changes as you use Visual
Basic. Visual Basic has a total of four
toolbars:<br><br>
•<b>Debug-</b>  This toolbar appears when you use
the interactive debugging tools to trace and
correct problems. <br><br>

•<b>Edit-</b>  This toolbar aids your editing of Visual
Basic code.<br><br>
•<b> Form Editor-</b> This toolbar helps you adjust
objects on forms.<br><br>
• <b>Standard.-</b>This toolbar is the default toolbar
that appears beneath the menu bar. <br><br>
<h4>Toolbox</h4>
• The Toolbox window differs from the toolbar.
The Toolbox window, typically called the
toolbox, is a collection of tools that act as a
repository of controls you can place on a form.<br><br>
• The Toolbox contains a set of controls that are
used to place on a Form at design time
thereby creating the user interface area.<br><br>


In Microsoft Visual Basic intrinsic controls (or
built-in controls) are those controls visible in
the Toolbox window when you launch Visual
Basic.<br><br>
This important group includes controls, such as
Label, Textbox, CommandButton controls, etc.
that are used in nearly every application. <br><br>


•<b> Pointer -</b>Provides a way to move and resize the
controls form. It is not a control. <br><br>
•<b>PictureBox - </b> Displays icons/bitmaps and
metafiles. It displays text or acts as a visual
container for other controls. <br><br>
•<b>TextBox -</b>  Used to display message and enter
text. <br><br>
• <b>Frame -</b>Serves as a visual and functional
container for controls <br><br>


<b>CommandButton -</b>Used to carry out the
specified action when the user chooses it. <br><br>
<b>CheckBox -</b>Displays a True/False or Yes/No
option. <br><br>
<b>OptionButton -</b>OptionButton control which is
a part of an option group allows the user to
select only one option even it displays multiple
choices.  <br><br>

• <b>ListBox -</b> Displays a list of items from which a
user can select one. <br><br>
• <b>ComboBox -</b> Contains a TextBox and a ListBox.
This allows the user to select an ietm from the
dropdown ListBox, or to type in a selection in
the TextBox. <br><br>
•<b>HScrollBar and VScrollBar - </b> These controls
allow the user to select a value within the
specified range of values  <br><br>

• <b>Timer -</b>Executes the timer events at specified
intervals of time. <br><br>
•<b>DriveListBox -</b>  Displays the valid disk drives
and allows the user to select one of them. <br><br>
• <b></b>DirListBox - Allows the user to select the
directories and paths, which are displayed.  <br><br>

•<b>FileListBox -</b>  Displays a set of files from which a
user can select the desired one. <br><br>
•<b>Shape -</b>  Used to add shape (rectangle, square
or circle) to a Form. <br><br>
• Line - Used to draw straight line to the Form 
<br><br>
• <b>Image -</b> used to display images such as icons,
bitmaps and metafiles. But less capability than
the PictureBox <br><br>
<b>Label -</b>Displays a text that the user cannot
modify or interact with. <br><br>



<center><h4>Project Explorer window(Project window) </h4></center>
• Docked on the right side of the screen, just
under the toolbar, is the Project Explorer
window. The Project Explorer is quick 
reference to the various elements of a project
namely form, classes and modules.<br><br>
• All of the object that make up the application
are packed in a project. A simple project will
typically contain one form, which is a window
that is designed as part of a program's
interface. <br><br>

It is possible to develop any number of forms
for use in a program, although a program may
consist of a single form.<br><br>
In addition to forms, the Project Explorer
window also lists code modules and classes. <br><br>

• The Project window lists its components in a
tree-structured listing. Related objects appear
together.<br><br>
• You can expand or shrink the details by clicking
the plus or minus signs that appear next to
object groups.<br><br>


For example, if you click the plus sign next to
the object labeled Forms, a list of the current
roject's forms will appear.<br><br>
When you double-click a form, that form's
Form window appears in the Form window
editing area. <br><br>

Each item in the Project window has both a
project name and a filename.<br><br>
In Visual Basic, you can assign names to
objects, such as forms and modules. <br><br>

• The following kinds of objects can appear in
the Project window:<br><br>
•<b>Projects </b> - An application might consist of
multiple projects, as can occur when you
create ActiveX controls. Projects always have
the filename extension .vbp<br><br>

<b>Forms -</b> The Project window displays a list of
your project's forms. Form files always have
the filename extension .frm<br><br>



<b>Modules-</b> Your project's modules hold general
and reusable routines comprised of Visual Basic
programming statements.<br><br>
You can use the same module in several
programs due to its general nature. Modules
always have the filename extension .bas<br><br>
<b>Class modules -</b> Class modules are special code
modules that define objects which are
designed for a project.<br><br>
Class module files always have the filename
extension .cls<br><br>

• <b>User controls - </b>User controls are ActiveX
controls you've added to the project. ActiveX
control files always have the filename
extension .ocx<br><br>
• <b>User documents-</b> User documents are
document objects that describe parts of your
project. User document files always have the
filename extension .dob<br><br>

<b>Property pages-</b> Property pages (such as those
found inside tabbed dialog boxes) that appear
in the project file describe a particular control.
Property page files always have the filename
extension .pag<br><br>






<center><h4>Properties Window </h4></center>
 The Properties Window is docked under the
Project Explorer window. The Properties
Window exposes the various characteristics of
selected objects.<br><br>
 Each and every form in an application is
considered an object.<br><br>
 Now, each object in Visual Basic has
characteristics such as color and size. 
<br><br>
 Other characteristics affect not just the
appearance of the object but the way it
behaves too. All these characteristics of an
object are called its properties.<br><br>
 So a form has properties and any controls
placed on it will have properties too. All of
these properties are displayed in the
Properties Window. <br><br>
<h4>• Form Window </h4>
Most of your work goes on inside the Form
window. You'll design all your application's
forms, which are the background windows
that your users see, in the central editing area
where the Form window appears. <br><br>

You can resize the Form window to make the
windows you create in your applications as
large or small as needed.<br><br>
Scrollbars appear to let you scroll the Form
window if you need to see parts of the forms
that run off the screen or underneath other
Visual Basic windows. <br><br>
<h4>Form Layout Window</h4>
• The Form Layout window is an interesting
little window connected closely to the Form
window, because the Form Layout window
shows you a preview of the Form window's
location <br><br>

If one or more forms appear in your Form
window, thumbnail sketches of those forms
will also appear in the Form Layout window.
The window shows you where each of the
forms will appear on the screen when your
user runs the application and, through using
the program, views the various forms <br><br>
<h4>Code Editor Window</h4>
• If you select Code View within the Project
Window, or if you double-click on a control
icon within the Form Design Window, the Code
Editor Window will open, displaying the Visual
Basic code associated with a particular object. 
<br><br>
Code Editor Window to write, display, and
edit Visual Basic code. You can open as
many code editor windows as you have
modules, so you can easily view the code in
different forms or modules, and copy and
paste between them.<br><br>
The code editor window contains two list
boxes at the top of the window. 
<br><br>
The left most list box is the Object Listbox; it
allows you to select the event procedures
associated with a particular object (e.g.
command button, form, label, textbox, etc.).<br><br>
The rightmost Listbox is called the Procedure
Listbox; for the current object, it allows you to
select the event procedure associated with a
particular type of event (e.g. Click, DragDrop,
KeyDown, MouseDown, etc.). <br><br>

A property is represented by a small icon that
has a hand holding a piece of paper. Methods
are denoted by little green blocks, while
events are denoted by yellow lightning bolt
icon. <br><br>
<h4>Object Browser</h4>
• The Object Browser allows us to browse
through the various properties, events and
methods that are made available to us.<br><br>
• It is accessed by selecting Object Browser from
the View menu or pressing the key F2 <br><br>

The left column of the Object Browser lists the
objects and classes that are available in the
projects that are opened and the controls that
have been referenced in them.<br><br>
It is possible for us to scroll through the list
and select the object or class that we wish to
inspect. <br><br>

After an object is picked up from the Classes
list, we can see its members (properties,
methods and events) in the right column.<br><br>





<center><h4>Event Driven Programming</h4></center>
Visual Basic, on the other hand, is based upon
an event-driven paradigm, in which each
feature included within the program is
activated only when the user responds to a
corresponding object (i.e., an icon, a checkbox,
an option button, a menu selection, etc.)
within the user interface. <br><br>

The program’s response to an action taken by
the user is referred to as an event.
An event is a signal that informs an application
that something important has occurred. It is
an action which you can respond to, or
“handle” in code. <br><br>

Events can be generated by a user action, such
as clicking the mouse or pressing a key; by
program code; or by system.<br><br>
<b>Note</b> - User initiates the event, but it is the
program’s response that actually defines the
event. The group of Basic commands that
brings about this response is called an eventprocedure. <br><br>

<b>Event-procedures</b> are Visual Basic procedures
that respond to events and are automatically
generated by the Visual Basic.<br><br>
The programmer adds code to respond to
specific events, and only events that are
relevant to a program need be coded <br><br>

In procedural languages, an application is
written is executed by checking for the
program logically through the program
statements, one after another. <br><br>

For a temporary phase, the control may be
transferred to some other point in a program.<br><br>
While in an event driven application, the
program statements are executed only when a
particular event calls a specific part of the
code that is assigned to the event. <br><br>
• Let us consider a TextBox control and a few of
its associated events to understand the
concept of event driven programming.<br><br>
• The TextBox control supports various events
such as Change, Click, MouseMove and many
more that will be listed in the Properties
dropdown list in the code window for the
TextBox control.<br><br>


• We will look into a few of them as given below.<br><br>
• The code entered in the Change event fires<br><br>
when there is a change in the contents of the
TextBox.<br><br>
• The Click event fires when the TextBox control
is clicked.<br><br>
• The MouseMove event fires when the mouse
is moved over the TextBox. <br><br>

<center><h4>Important Common Properties of
Command Buttons, Text Boxes, and
Labels</h4></center>



•<h4> Name </h4> <br><br>
• You use a control's Name property in code to
refer to the control object when you want to
manipulate its properties or methods.<br><br>
• You should always rename a control a meaningful
name as soon as you place it on its container.
Most VB programmers use the "Hungarian
notation" convention for naming controls and
variables. This means that the name of each
control begins with a lowercase iaprefix that is
one to three (or sometimes four or five) letters
long. The prefix is the same for all objects of the
same type. <br><br>
• Although you can reference the control's
Name property directly in code (though it's
almost never necessary), you cannot change
the Name property at runtime. <br><br>
<h4> Enabled</h4>
• The Enabled property of a control is a
True/False property that you can set to
determine whether or not the control can
receive focus or respond to user-generated
events such as the Click event. <br><br>
• Many controls' Caption or Text properties
(including the CommandButton, TextBox and
Label) will appear fainter or "grayed out" to
the user when you set their Enabled
properties to False <br><br>

• Since the Label control never gets focus, its
Enabled property has no effect on whether
the user can set focus to the Label (the user
never could set focus to a Label, anyway). <br><br>
• However, an enabled Label can still receive
events such as the Click and DblClick events
when the mouse pointer is over it. Setting the
Label's Enabled property to False disables
these events for the Label as it does for other
controls.<br><br>
• You can set a control's Enabled property at
both design time and runtime. <br><br>
<h4>Visible</h4>
• This property is True by default. Setting it to
False means that the control will not be visible
to the user. If you set Visible to False at design
time, you (the programmer) will still be able to
see the control on the design surface but the
user won't be able to see it at runtime. You
can set the Visible property at both design
time and runtime. <br><br>
<h4>TabIndex and TabStop</h4>
• The TabIndex property determines the order
in which controls on a form get focus when
the user presses the Tab key. Note that Labels
have a TabIndex property even though they
can't receive focus. <br><br>
• The TabStop property lets you specify whether
or not a user can use the Tab key to navigate
to the control. Its default value is True. If you
set TabStop to False, users will bypass the
control as they cycle through the TabIndex
order when they press the Tab key. <br><br>


<center><h4>Important Properties,events &
methods of the TextBox Control </h4></center>



• The HideSelection property is True by default
and it signifies that the user-highlighted
contents of the TextBox will not remain
highlighted when focus shifts to another
object. If you want the highlighted contents to
remain highlighted, just set HideSelection to
False. <br><br>
• The MaxLength property determines the
maximum number of characters that the user
can enter into the Text property of the
TextBox. If you set MaxLength to 0, there is no
limit on the number of characters that the
user can enter (well, up to 32K, that is) <br><br>
• The Locked property allows the TextBox to
reject user changes but still allows the user to
set focus to the TextBox. Therefore, the user
can scroll through the contents of a TextBox
without accidentally changing anything.
Contrast this to the Enabled property which
doesn't allow the user to set focus to the
TextBox. <br><br>
• The MultiLine property is only writable at
design time, although you can find out its
value at runtime. MultiLine is False by default,
meaning that everything in the TextBox
control will appear on a single line. If
MultiLine is set to True, the TextBox will
perform word-wrapping and also break a
typed line after a hard return. <br><br>
• The PasswordChar property defines a
character that will appear on the screen in
place of the actual characters in the Text
property. The underlying value of the Text
property still contains the actual characters
typed by the user, but for each character
typed, only the password character will
appear. Typically programmers set this
property to an asterisk (*) for TextBox controls
that represent the password on login screens. <br><br>
• The ScrollBars property is only writable at
design time, although you can check its value
at runtime. The default value is None, but you
can also choose Horizontal, Vertical, or Both.
Scrollbars enable the user to scroll vertically
through the contents of a multiple line
TextBox or horizontally through wide contents
of TextBoxes. <br><br>
• The Text property is the TextBox control's default
property. You can set it at design time or runtime,
and you can also read it at runtime. The Text
property represents the current visible, editable
(not necessarily visible or editable, depending on
the value of the Visible property, Enabled and/or
Locked) contents of the TextBox. Since Text is the
TextBox control's default property, code such as
txtName = "Elizabeth" <br><br>
• TextBox controls have no Caption property.<br><br>

<center><h4>Important Properties and events
of the Label Control </h4></center>


• Use the Alignment property to align text
inside the Label—left-, right-, or centeraligned, or not aligned (None). <br><br>
• The Appearance, BackStyle, and BorderStyle
properties together help determine the
general appearance of the Label. For instance,
if you leave Appearance at its default setting
of 1-3d, set BackColor to vbWhite, and set
BorderStyle to Fixed Single, you can give the
Label the same look as that of a TextBox. <br><br>
• Use the AutoSize and WordWrap properties to
determine how the Label displays lengthy text in
its Caption. If you set the AutoSize property of
the Label to True (default is False), the Label
automatically shrinks or stretches to the exact
size needed to display the text. The WordWrap
property determines whether or not an autosized
Label changes size in a horizontal direction
(WordWrap = False, its default value) or in a
vertical direction (WordWrap = True). Remember,
WordWrap has an effect only if you first set
AutoSize to True. <br><br>
• The Label's Default property, Caption, holds
the text that is visible to the user on the
Label's surface.<br><br>


<center><h4>Variables and Constant in Visual
Basic 6</h4>
</center>

• These are the rules to follow when naming elements
in VB - variables, constants, controls, procedures, and
so on:<br><br>
• A name must begin with a letter.<br><br>
• May be as much as 255 characters long (but don't
forget that somebody has to type the stuff!).<br><br>
• Must not contain a space or an embedded period or
type-declaration characters used to specify a data type;
these are ! # % $ & @<br><br>
• Must not be a reserved word (that is part of the code,
like Option, for example)<br><br>
• The dash, although legal, should be avoided because it
may be confused with the minus sign. Instead of Firstname use First_name or FirstName. <br><br>
• Variables are the memory locations which are
used to store values temporarily. A defined
naming strategy has to be followed while
naming a variable. A variable name must
begin with an alphabet letter and should not
exceed 255 characters. It must be unique
within the same scope. It should not contain
any special character like %, &, !, #, @ or $. <br><br>



<h4>Adding Comments </h4>
• Comments provide a convenient means to
document a program. Visual Basic ignores
comments when it compiles your program.
Comment lines begin with a single apostrophe
( ' ), followed by a textual message, and can be
added anywhere in a procedure. By default,
comments are displayed as green text  <br><br>
•<b>Rem</b>  Program to calculate the sum of two
numbers<br><br>
• Sum = num1 + num2<br><br>
• Here Rem is known as remark which will work
as comment here. <br><br>
• Declaring a variable tells Visual Basic to
reserve space in memory. It is not must that a
variable should be declared before using it.
Automatically whenever Visual Basic
encounters a new variable, it assigns the
default variable type and value. This is called
implicit declaration. <br><br>
• Though this type of declaration is easier for
the user, to have more control over the
variables, it is advisable to declare them
explicitly. The variables are declared with a
Dim statement to name the variable and its
type. The As type clause in the Dim statement
allows to define the data type or object type
of the variable. This is called explicit
declaration. <br><br>
•  <b>Syntax</b><br><br>
Dim variable [As Type]<br><br>
• <b>For example, </b><br><br>
Dim strName As String<br><br>
Dim intCounter As Integer <br><br>





<center><h4>
Option Explicit</h4></center>
• This forces the user to declare all the
variables. The Option Explicit statement
checks in the module for usage of any
undeclared variables and reports an error to
the user. The user can thus rectify the error on
seeing this error message. 
• The Option Explicit statement can be explicitly
placed in the general declaration section of
each module using the following steps.
• Click Options item in the Tools menu
• Click the Editor tab in the Options dialog box
• Check Require Variable Declaration option and
then click the OK button 
<center><h4>Scope of variables</h4></center>
• A variable is scoped to a procedure-level
(local) or module-level variable depending on
how it is declared. The scope of a variable,
procedure or object determines which part of
the code in our application are aware of the
variable's existence <br><br>
• A variable is declared in general declaration
section of a Form, and hence is available to all
the procedures. Local variables are recognized
only in the procedure in which they are
declared. They can be declared with Dim and
Static keywords. If we want a variable to be
available to all of the procedures within the
same module, or to all the procedures in an
application, a variable is declared with
broader scope. <br><br>
<h4>Local Variables </h4>
• A local variable is one that is declared inside a
procedure. This variable is only available to
the code inside the procedure and can be
declared using the Dim statements as given
below.<br><br>
• Dim sum As Integer <br><br>
• The local variables exist as long as the
procedure in which they are declared, is
executing. Once a procedure is executed, the
values of its local variables are lost and the
memory used by these variables is freed and
can be reclaimed. Variables that are declared
with keyword Dim exist only as long as the
procedure is being executed. <br><br>
<h4>Static Variables</h4>
• Static variables are not reinitialized each time
Visual Invokes a procedure and therefore retains
or preserves value even when a procedure ends.
In case we need to keep track of the number of
times a command button in an application is
clicked, a static counter variable has to be
declared. These static variables are also ideal for
making controls alternately visible or invisible. A
static variable is declared as given below.<br><br>
• Static intPermanent As Integer <br><br>
• Static intPermanent As Integer<br><br>
• Variables have a lifetime in addition to scope.<br><br>
The values in a module-level and public
variables are preserved for the lifetime of an
application whereas local variables declared
with Dim exist only while the procedure in
which they are declared is still being executed. <br><br>
• The value of a local variable can be preserved
using the Static keyword. The following
procedure calculates the running total by
adding new values to the previous values
stored in the static variable value.<br><br>
• Function RunningTotal ( )<br><br>
Static Accumulate<br><br>
Accumulate = Accumulate + num<br><br>
RunningTotal = Accumulate<br><br>
End Function <br><br>
• If the variable Accumulate was declared with
Dim instead of static, the previously
accumulated values would not be preserved
across calls to the procedure, and the
procedure would return the same value with
which it was called. <br><br>
• To make all variables in a procedure static, the
Static keyword is placed at the beginning of
the procedure heading as given in the below
statement.<br><br>
Static Function RunningTotal ( ) <br><br>
•  <b>Example</b>
• The following is an example of an event
procedure for a CommandButton that counts and
displays the number of clicks made.<br><br>
• Private Sub Command1_Click ( )<br><br>
Static Counter As Integer<br><br>
Counter = Counter = 1<br><br>
Print Counter<br><br>
End Sub<br><br>
• The first time we click the CommandButton, the
Counter starts with its default value of zero.
Visual Basic then adds 1 to it and prints the
result.<br><br>
