  <center><h2>Java Tutorial</h2></center>

   <p><center><h3>  Introduction to Java</h3></center>
  
    • Java is a programming language and a platform. <br>
    • Java is a high level, object-oriented and secure programming
    language.<br>
    <center><h4>Platform </h4></center>
    • Any hardware or software environment in which a program
    runs, is known as a platform.<br>
    • Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is
    called a platform.<br>
    <center> <h4>Application (Where Java is used)</h4>  </center>
    • According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java.<br>
    • There are many devices where Java is currently used.<br>
    • Some of them are as follows:<br>

    • Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player,
    antivirus, etc.<br>
    • Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.<br>
    • Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.<br>
<br>
    • Mobile<br>
    • Embedded System<br>
    • Smart Card<br>
<br>
    • Robotics<br>
    • Games, etc.<br>
    <center> <h4>Types of Java Applications</h4> </center>
    • There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created
    using Java programming:<br>
  <h4>   1) Standalone Application</h4>
    • Standalone applications are also known as desktop
    applications or window-based applications.
<br>
    • These are traditional software that we need to install on every
    machine.<br>
    • Examples of standalone application are Media player,
    antivirus, etc.<br>
    • AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone
    applications.<br>

    <h4> 2) Web Application</h4>
    • An application that runs on the server side and creates a
    dynamic page is called a web application.<br>
    • Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate etc.
    technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.<br>

   <h4>  3) Enterprise Application</h4>
    • An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking
    applications, etc. is called enterprise application.<br>
    • It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing
    etc.<br>
    • In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.
<br><h4>
    4) Mobile Application </h4>
    • An application which is created for mobile devices is called a
    mobile application.<br>
    • Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile
    applications.<br>

    <center><h4>Java Platforms / Editions </h4></center>
    • There are Following platforms or editions of Java:
    <h4> 1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)</h4>
    • It is a Java programming platform.<br>
    • It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io,
    java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. <br>

    • It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner
    classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing,
    Reflection, Collection, etc.<br>
<br>
  <h4>  2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) </h4>
    • It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web
    and enterprise applications.<br>
    • It is built on the top of the Java SE platform.<br>
    • It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB etc.<br>

     <h4>3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)</h4>
    • It is a micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile
    applications<br>



     <center><h3>History of Java</h3></center>
    • James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the
    Java language project in June 1991.<br>

    • The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.<br>
    • Initially designed for small, embedded systems in electronic
    appliances like set-top boxes.<br>

    • Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the
    file extension was .gt.<br>
    • After that, it was called Oak.<br>

    • Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a
    national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France,
    Germany, Romania, etc.<br>
    • In 1995, Oak was renamed as ”Java”.<br>

    • Why java? Java is an island of Indonesia where the first
    coffee was produced (called java coffee).<br>
    • Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee
    near his office.<br>

    • Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the
    father of Java<br>
    <h4>Java Version History </h4>
    • Many java versions have been released till now.<br>
    • The current stable release of Java is Java SE 10.<br>

    • JDK Alpha and Beta (1995)<br>
    • JDK 1.0 (23rd Jan 1996)<br>
    • JDK 1.1 (19th Feb 1997)<br>

   <center><h3> Features of Java </h3></center>
    • The features of Java are also known as java buzzwords.<br>
    • A list of most important features of Java language is given
    below.<br>

    1. Simple<br>
    2. Object-Oriented<br>
    3. Portable<br>
    4. Platform independent
    <br>
    5. Secured<br>
    6. Robust<br>
    7. Architecture neutral<br>


    <h4> 1. Simple</h4>
    • According to Sun, Java language is a simple programming
    language because:<br>
    • Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to
    learn it after C++).<br>
    Cont…
    • Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features,
    for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.<br>
    • There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because
    there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.<br>
   <h4> 2. Object-oriented </h4>
    • Java is an object-oriented programming language.<br>
    • Everything in Java is an object and it follow the Objectoriented programming (OOPs) concept.
    Cont…<br>
    • Basic concepts of OOPs are:<br>
    A. Class<br>
    B. Object<br>
    C. Inheritance<br>
    Cont…
    D. Polymorphism<br>
    E. Abstraction<br>
    F. Encapsulation<br>
    Cont…
    <h5>A. Class </h5>
    • A class is a group of objects which have common properties.<br>
    • It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a
    logical entity. It can't be physical.<br>
    Cont…
    • A class in Java can contain:<br>
    • Fields<br>
    • Methods<br>
    • Constructors<br>
    • Blocks<br>
    • Nested class and interface<br>
    Cont…<br>
   <h5> B. Object</h5>
    • An object is an instance of a class.<br>
    • An object in Java is the physical because when we are
    creating a object then memory will be allocated for object<br>
    • Object will be created with the help of new keyword.<br>
    Cont…
  <h5>  C. Inheritance</h5>
    • Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one class inherit
    the property of another class.<br>
    <h5>D. Polymorphism</h5>
    • Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform
    a single action in different ways. <br>
    Cont…
    • Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and
    morphs.<br>
    • The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.
    So polymorphism means many forms.<br>
    Cont…
   <h5> E. Abstraction</h5>
    • Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and
    showing only functionality to the user.
    Cont…<br>
    <h5>F. Encapsulation</h5>
    • Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code
    (Function/method) and data together into a single unit,<br>
    • for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.<br>
    <h4> 3. Portable</h4> 
    • Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java
    bytecode to any platform.<br>
    <h4> 4. Platform independent</h4>
    • Java is platform independent because Java code can be run on
    multiple platforms,<br>
    • for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc.
    Cont…<br>
    • Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into
    bytecode.<br>
    • This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can
    be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run
    Anywhere(WORA).<br>



    <h4> 5. Secured</h4>
    • Java is secured because:<br>
    • No explicit pointer<br>
    • Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox<br>
    
 <h4>   6. Robust</h4>
    • Robust simply means strong. Java is robust because:<br>
    • It uses strong memory management.<br>
    • There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.<br>
    Cont…
    • There is automatic garbage collection in java which runs on
    the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not
    being used by a Java application anymore.<br>
    • All these points make Java robust.<br>
    <h4>7. Architecture-neutral</h4>
    • Java is architecture neutral because there are no
    implementation dependent features,<br>
    • for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.
    Cont…<br>
    • In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory
    for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit
    architecture.<br>
   


     <center><h4>Java Bytecode</h4></center>
• Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into
bytecode. <br>
• This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can
be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run
Anywhere(WORA).<br>

 <center><h4>JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</h4></center>
• JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.<br>
• It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically
exist.<br>
• It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in
which Java bytecode can be executed.<br>
Cont…
• JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the
configuration of each OS is different from each other.<br>
• However, Java is platform independent.<br>
Cont…
• The JVM performs the following main tasks:<br>
• Loads code<br>
• Verifies code<br>
• Executes code<br>
• Provides runtime environment<br>
 <center><h4>JVM Architecture</h4></center>
( Internal architecture of JVM)<br>
• It contains class loader, memory area, execution engine etc.<br>


 <h4>1) Classloader</h4>
• Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load
class files. <br>
• Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the
classloader.<br>
<h4>2) Class(Method) Area</h4>
• Class(Method) Area stores per-class structures such as the
runtime constant pool, method data, the code for methods.
Cont…<br>
<h4>3) Heap</h4>
• It is the runtime data area in which objects are allocated.<br>
<h4>4) Stack</h4>
• It holds local variables.<br>
Cont…
<h4>5) Program Counter Register</h4>
• PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java
virtual machine instruction currently being executed.<br>
<h4>6) Native Method Stack</h4>
• It contains all the native methods used in the application.
Cont…<br>
<h4>7) Execution Engine</h4>
• It contains:<br>
• A virtual processor<br>
• Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.<br>
• Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance.<br>
Cont…
<h4>8) Java Native Interface</h4>
• Java Native Interface (JNI) is a framework which provides an
interface to communicate with another application written in
another language like C, C++, Assembly etc.<br>









<center><h3>JRE </h3></center>
• JRE Stands for Java Runtime Environment. <br>
• It is used to provide the runtime environment. <br>
• It physically exists. <br>
• It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime. <br>
<center><h3>JDK</h3></center>
• JDK stands for Java Development Kit. <br>
• The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development
environment which is used to develop Java applications <br>
• It physically exists. <br>
• It contains JRE + development tools. <br>

 <center><h3>Java Tokens</h3></center>
• A token is the smallest element of a program that is
meaningful to the compiler.<br>
 <h4>Types of Tokens</h4>
• Keywords<br>
• Identifiers<br>
• Literals<br>
• Operators<br>
• Separators<br>
• Comments<br>
 <center><h3>Keywords</h3></center>
• These are the pre-defined reserved words of any
programming language.<br>
• Each keyword has a special meaning.<br>
• It is always written in lower case. Java provides the following
keywords:<br>
<pre>

01. abstract 02. boolean 03. byte 04. break 05. class
06. case 07. catch 08. char 09. continue 10. default
11. do 12. double 13. else 14. extends 15. final
16. finally 17. float 18. for 19. if 20. implements

26. native 27. new 28. package 29. private 30. protected
31. public 32. return 33. short 34. static 35. super
36. switch 37. synchronized 38. this 39. throw 40. throws
41. transient 42. try 43. void 44. volatile 45. while
46. assert 47. const 48. enum 49. goto 50. strictfp</pre>

• The keywords const and goto are reserved but not used. <br>





<center><h3>Identifiers </h3></center>
• Identifiers are used to name a variable, constant, function,
class, and array. <br>
• It usually defined by the user.  <br>
Cont…
• It uses letters, underscores, or a dollar sign as the first
character. <br>
• Remember that the identifier name must be different from the
reserved keywords. <br>
Cont…
• There are some rules to declare identifiers are: <br>
• The first letter of an identifier must be a letter, underscore or a
dollar sign. It cannot start with digits but may contain digits. <br>
• The whitespace cannot be included in the identifier. <br>
• Identifiers are case sensitive. <br>
Cont…
• Some valid identifiers are: <br>
• PhoneNumber <br>
• PRICE <br>
• radius <br>
• a <br>
• a1 <br>
• _phonenumber <br>
• $circumference <br>
• jagged_array <br>
Cont…
• Invalid identifier names include these: <br>
• 2count <br>
• high-temp <br>
• not/ok <br>
 <center><h3>Literals</h3></center>
• In programming literal is a notation that represents a fixed
value (constant) in the source code. <br>
• It can be categorized as an integer literal, string literal,
Boolean literal, etc.
Cont… <br>
• It is defined by the programmer. <br>
• Once it has been defined cannot be changed.  <br>
Cont…
• Java provides five types of literals are as follows: <br>
• Integer ( Ex: 2, 4) <br>
• Floating Point (Ex: 12.3, 16.8) <br>
• Character (Ex: ‘A’, ‘a’) <br>
• String (Ex: “Ram”, “Hello”) <br>
• Boolean (Ex: true, false) <br>
 <center><h3>Separators</h3></center>
• The separators in Java is also known as punctuators. <br>
• Square Brackets []: It is used to define array elements. A
pair of square brackets represents the single-dimensional <br>
array, two pairs of square brackets represent the twodimensional array.
• Parentheses (): It is used to call the functions.
Cont… <br>
• Curly Braces {}: The curly braces denote the starting and
ending of a code block. <br>
• Comma (,): It is used to separate two values and parameters. <br>
• Assignment Operator (=): It is used to assign a variable and
constant. <br>
Cont…
• Semicolon (;): It is the symbol that can be found at end of the <br>
statements. It separates the two statements. <br>
• Period (.): It separates the package name form the subpackages and class. It also separates a variable or method
from a reference variable. <br>
 <center><h3>Java Comments</h3></center>
• The Java comments are the statements that are not executed
by the compiler and interpreter. <br>
• The comments can be used to provide information or
explanation about the variable, method, class or any
statement. <br>
Cont…
• It can also be used to hide program code. <br>
Types of Java Comments <br>
• There are three types of comments in Java. <br>
• Single Line Comment <br>
• Multi Line Comment <br>
• Documentation Comment <br>
<h4>1) Java Single Line Comment </h4>
• The single line comment is used to comment only one line. <br>
• Syntax: <br>
<pre>
//This is single line comment
Example:
class CommentExample1
{
public static void main(String a[])
{
int i=10; //Here, i is a variable
System.out.println(i);
}
}
Output: 10</pre>
<h4>2) Java Multi Line Comment</h4>
• The multi line comment is used to comment multiple lines of
code. <br>
• Syntax: <br>
<pre>
/*
This
is
multi line
comment
*/
Example:
class CommentExample2
{
public static void main(String a[])
{
/* Let's declare and
print variable in java. */
int i=10;
System.out.println(i);
}
}
Output: 10
</pre>
<h4>3) Java Documentation Comment</h4>
• The documentation comment is used to create documentation
API. <br>
• To create documentation API, you need to use javadoc tool. <br>
• Syntax: <br>
/**
<pre>
This
is
documentation
comment
*/
Example:
/** The Calculator class provides methods to get addition and subtraction of given 2 numbers.*/
public class Calculator
{
/** The add() method returns addition of given numbers.*/
public int add(int a, int b)
{
return a+b;
}
/** The sub() method returns subtraction of given numbers.*/
public int sub(int a, int b)
{
return a-b;
}
}
</pre>Cont…
• Compile it by javac tool: <br>
• javac Calculator.java <br>
• Create Documentation API by javadoc tool: <br>
• javadoc Calculator.java <br>
• Now, there will be HTML files created for your Calculator class in the
current directory. <br>
<center><h3>Whitespace </h3></center>
• Java is a free-form language. <br>
• This means that you do not need to follow any special
indentation rules.
Cont… <br>
• For example, Program could have been written all on one
line or in any other strange way you felt like typing it, as long
as there was at least one whitespace character between each
token that was not already delineated by an operator or
separator. <br>
• In java, whitespace is a space, tab, or new line.
Data Types in Java <br>
• Type of the data is called data type. <br>
• Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be
stored in the variable. <br>
Cont…
• There are two types of data types in Java: <br>
• Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean,
char, byte, short, int, long, float and double. <br>
• Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types
include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays. <br>
