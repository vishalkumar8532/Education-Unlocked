<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>
<p>
The word environment means surroundings. Environment is
the sum of all external factors (biotic and abiotic) that
influence the life of an organism. <br>
Biotic factors include all living beings e.g, men, animals,
plants and micro-organisms.
physico-chemical entities like air, water, soil, rocks, minerals, Abiotic factors include all
mountains etc. <br>
  <h4>Types of Environment</h4> 
<b> Non-essential life assisting environment:</b> Here evironment is
perceived as any kind of surrounding that is non-essential for life to exist
physically. It is another fact that these are often accessory for life, or add some
additional or relevant dimension to life. Examples are socio-economic
environment, cultural environment, business environment, work place
environment, family environment, extra-terrestrial environment etc. Without
this kind of surrounding life can exist in physical sense.<br>
<b>Essential life supporting bio-physical environment:</b>  It includes biophysical entities as well as the processes that contribute in providing us
(human as well as other living beings) the basic material needs of life e.g,
oxygen, wate, food, habitat etc, so that life can exist It can be natural (e.g,
forest) or human engineered (e.g-, urban town) or a mixture of both (e.g,
village and agricultural landscape). In fact the concepts of environmental
sciences are based on this meaning.<br>
 <center><h3>Segments of Bio-physical or seg</h3></center>
Natural Environment: -----------
Bio-physical or natural environment consists of foun basic segments:  <br>
<b> Atmosphere,<br>
Hydrosphere,<br>
lithosphere <br>and
Biosphere <br></b>
<center><h4>Atmosphere </h4></center>
Definition: Atmosphere is the gaseous envelope of the earth.<br>
Composition: It is composed of major gases viz. N, (78%), O2 (21%), Ar (0.9%)
and CO (385 ppm); minor gases viz. H, Ne, CHa SO O, NO, NH etc. (in
varying concentration); water vapour and solid particles.<br>
Vertical structure: Atmosphere extends up to 500km vertically and consists
of following 5 layers:<br>
Troposphere,<br>
Stratosphere,<br>
Mesosphere,<br>
Thermosphere and<br>
lonosphere.<br>

<h4>Functions of Atmosphere </h4>
Major Functions of the atmosphere are as following:<br>
Feeding functions:Atmosphere contains O, and CO which are essential for
respiration and photosynthesis.<br>
Protection Functions: It protects the earth from temperature extremes and
maintains moderate temperature (17C). It also protects from harmful UV-rays
and cosmic rays and falling meteors.<br>
Circulation Functions: It helps in circulation or transport of matter and
energy across different regions of the earth. It include climatic events,
hydrology etc.<br>

<center><h3>ECOSYSTEM</h3></center>


• Ecosystem can be defined as a structural and functional unit of bio
-sphere,  consisting  of  biotic  and  abiotic  components,  both 
interacting and exchanging material between them.<br>
• The  term  ecosystem  was  given  by  Sir  Arthur  Tansely  in  1935. 
Ecosystem is also called as Holocoenosis.<br>
• Examples:  Forest  ecosystem,  grassland  ecosystem,  pond 
ecosystem etc. <br>

<h4>Classification of Ecosystem </h4>

• Ecosystems are often categorized based on nature of medium or surrounding. 
Diagrammatic representation of the classification is as follows:
• I. Natural ecosystem
• 1. Terrestrial ecosystems
• i. Forest ecosystem e.g., different forests
• ii. Grassland ecosystem e.g., different grasslands
• iii. Desert ecosystem e.g., different deserts
• 2. Aquatic ecosystems
• i. Fresh water ecosystem
• a. Lentic ecosystem e.g., ponds, lakes etc.
• b. Lotic ecosystem e.g., springs rivers etc.
• ii. Estuarine ecosystem e.g., estuaries, mangroves etc.
• iii. Marine ecosystem e.g., seas, oceans etc.
• II. Man-made ecosystem e.g., Microcosm  experiments,  constructed wetlands, 
intensive agriculture (to certain extent) etc.

Structure of Ecosystem <h4></h4>
BCHS 0202 Environmental Studies 4
• Major  structural  parameters  include  components,  factors,  trophic 
organizations, species composition and stratification. 
• Components
• Ecosystem  consists  of  many small  units  known  as  components.  These 
components have been fairly categorized as per following scheme:
• Ecosystem has two basic components:
• Biotic component i.e., the living part of the ecosystem
• Abiotic component i.e., the non-living part of the ecosystem
• I. Biotic component is divided into two parts:

• (A). Biotic component is divided into two parts:
• 1- Autotrophs or Producers i.e., which themselves make their food. e.g., green
plants, algae, certain bacteria etc.
• 2- Heterotrophs i.e., which derive food from others. They are further divided
into two parts:
• (I) Consumers i.e., which feed on other living beings and include majority of
animals. Consumers are further divided into three to four groups:
» Primary consumers or Herbivores i.e., which feed on producers,
e.g., rabbit, deer, cow, rat, grasshopper etc.
» Secondary consumers or Carnivores i.e., which feed on primary
consumers, e.g., frog, lizard, cat, fox etc.
» Tertiary consumers or Top Carnivores i.e., which feed on
primary or secondary consumers. e.g., lion, leopard, eagle etc.
» Top consumer or Omnivore i.e., which feed on all trophic levels
– producer to tertiary consumers. e.g., man
• (II) Decomposers i.e., which feed on dead plants and animals convert them into
simple compounds. e.g., bacteria, fungi etc.

• (B).  Abiotic component is divided into three major groups:
• 1. Climatic component
    Light
    Temperature
     Rainfall 
     Humidity
• 2. Geographic or geomorphic component
           Latitude and altitude
           Topography and land morphology
           Aspects or orientation towards the sun
• 3. Edaphic component
           Soil moisture, soil temperature etc.
           Physical characteristics of soil e.g., bulk density, texture etc.
           Chemical characteristics of soil e.g., pH, organic matter, inorganic   
           nutrients, salinity etc.

Structure of Ecosystem
• Factors: 
• Factors are the agents which influence any species in an ecosystem.  
• Both biotic and abiotic components also act as ecological factors.
• Trophic Organization: 
• Pattern of  food relationships  is  called trophic  organization.  There  are 
several  trophic  levels  in  the  ecosystem  viz.  Producers,  Primary 
Consumers, Secondary Consumers, Tertiary Consumers, Top Consumers.
• Trophic  organization  can  be  graphically  represented  by  means  of 
ecological pyramids.  Pyramids can be of number, biomass and energy.
• Pyramids  of  number  and  biomass  can  be  upright  and  inverted  both. 
Pyramid of energy is always upright.


• Species Composition:   
• Species composition means number of species present in an ecosystem. 
It is also called as species richness, or species diversity.
• Species  can  show  different  functional  types  viz.  Unique  Functional, 
Redundant Functional Group, keystone species.
• Species diversity is generally proportionate to productivity and stability.
• Stratification: 
• Presence of  layers (stratum) in  vertical structure of ecosystem is  called 
stratification. 
• Stratification  is  generally  proportional  to  diversity,  productivity  and 
stability of the ecosystems.

Functions of Ecosystem<h4></h4>

• Productivity, decomposition, energy flow and succession  are the major 
functions of the ecosystem.
• Productivity
• Productivity  is  the  rate  of  biomass  production  by  living  beings  in  an 
ecosystem  i.e.,  biomass  production  in  unit  area  and  unit  time.  It  is 
expressed as gm-2year-1
. 
• Productivity  can  be  primary  productivity  (related  to  producers)  and 
secondary productivity (related to consumers).
• Primary productivity is of two types : Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) 
and Net Primary Productivity (NPP)
• NPP = GPP - (Respiration + Maintenance)
• Tropical forests and estuaries show highest productivity while desert and 
open seas and ocean show lowest values.

• Decomposition
• It is breaking down of dead plant and animals and their excreta into simple 
compounds like CO2
, H2O and nutrients (minerals).  Bacteria and fungi are the 
major decomposers. This process ensures recycling of nutrients in the 
ecosystem.  
• Warm and moist ecosystem have high decomposition rate while cold and dry 
ecosystems have low decomposition rates.
• Energy Flow
• Energy flow means  transfer of  energy from  one trophic  level to  next trophic 
level. 
• In each transfer step a large amount (90%) of energy is lost in respiration 
and maintenance; and only a small portion (10%) is transferred.  
• Energy  flow  is  always  unidirectional  and  energy  pyramids  are  always 
upright.

• Succession
• Succession is the sequential change in the community structure resulting 
in establishment of stable or climax community.
• Succession  can  be  primary  (starting  from  bare  ground)  or  secondary 
(starting from existing community).
• Examples: Xerosere or Xerarch (i.e., succession starting from rocks) and 
Hydrosere or Hydrarch (i.e., succession starting from water bodies). 
• Xerosere procees through following sequence of Seral Communities: 
• Rock   Moss    Ferns    Grasses   Herbs  Bushes  Trees 
Climax Forests  

<h4></h4>Balanced Ecosystem
• Ecosystems  which  represent  integrity  in  structure  and  functions  and 
show sustainability are called balanced ecosystem.
• Integrity  of  structure  and  functions  means  such  ecosystem  fulfill  the 
basic  conditions  of  a  typical  ecosystem  in  terms  of  structure  and 
functions.
• Sustainability means that the ecosystem is able to sustain its community 
over a long period of time without any external intervention.
• Balanced  ecosystems  are  often represented  by  climax  communities  in 
terms of various structural and functional characteristics.
• To achieve  balance  or sustainability  of  ecosystem  is  one  of  the  major 
goals of environmental science and ecology.

<h4></h4>Features of
Balanced Ecosystem
• Major structural features of balanced ecosystems 
include:
• Threshold minimum size (not too small)
• High species diversity
• Complex trophic organization
• Moderate climatic conditions
• High complexity and stratification

• Major functional features of balanced ecosystems include:
• Moderate to high productivity
• High energy use efficiency
• High nutrient use efficiency
• Proper functioning of biogeochemical cycles
• High level of stability and re-silence
